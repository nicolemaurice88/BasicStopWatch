# BasicStopWatch
A basic stopwatch I created for a class project.

It begins with an intro screen, where the user will proceed to the main application by pressing "Begin".
There are 3 functions: begin, pause, and reset. If the user chooses to reset, a dialog will pop up and prompt the user. 
After it resets, the previous time will clear.
